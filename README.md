Spareshub.com Clone Project
In this blog post, I’m going to talk about sparehub.com clone, a website that we built up for our Unit-2 construct week submission. Website development is fun when all the team members collaborate and make a good website. Let me introduce you to my team-mates (in no particular order)

What is spareshub.com?

A website that helps customers buy genuine spare parts of most of the cars in India. We have eased the searching process in which customers have less headache in getting spare parts for their cars and getting them delivered to the doorsteps.

Our team built this website on using following languages,

Html
CSS
JavaScript
Main website link: https://spareshub.com/

Deployed Link :https://spareshub-clone.netlify.app/

Below are some of the attached pictures of the website.

As this was our first ever team project, we faced a lot of challenges. Github, a place where the world build the software was new to us. We faced challenges in creating repositories and pushing/pulling the code, it was all fun and games until we realised that it was easy (deliberate practice). We overcame all the challenges and worked towards the completion of the project in one week.

As we are still in the learning phase, the journey of building this website was very nice. We realised we could’ve achieved even more precision in building the website, but time was running out.

We still managed to pull this job to satisfactory results. Everyone was happy about it, it was like working hard on the farm, and then reaping the benefits of the tasty grains. The feeling of completing the project was very satisfying. Hard work pays off.
